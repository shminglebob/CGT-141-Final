## game dev

i think i want to develop a game. or at least start. i made a game dev doc for one of my finals that i was quite proud of so i think that i wanna try and make it. its probably gonna be pretty hard but im hoping i wont give up on this one lol.

## learning photography

during my vacation on the winter break i didnt really have great signal. so i was thinking alot. honestly this page was also a result of me thinking. i just thought that maybe i should pull my life together. ive kinda just been coasting along without much care. anyways enough yapping. for this goal, i wanted to try and learn photography so later when i find something/someone important (probably a cat lol) i wanna take a pic of, then i could be proud of the pics i took.

i think i have another mini goal that helps me achieve the second one. i want to create another instagram account. maybe a lil more formal or at least with a little more effort put into it lol. but i want to post pics of what ive cooked or js things i think are interesting. i think thatll help me achieve my goal of trying to learn photography but also gives me another thing to do instead of gaming 24/7 lol. honestly i dont really think this goal is that achievable for me right now since im honestly quite embarrassed to cook in front of most of my current roommates. well at least ill have this goal for when im living more privately i guess.

## thanking others & building my identity

this is probably my last goal but i just wanna thank others for the work theyve done. i think im too passive and honestly lack much of an identity. this goal really came to me while i was on vacation as i thought that a lot of the people who made the trip possible woke up really early just to work for a salary thats definitely unlivable. not to say that to disrespect them but the work they put in just doesnt really translate to how much theyre making. (sorry if that sounded rude, im not trying to be im js not good at communicating my thoughts *sob pray*) 

personally i think that i should do something to at least give back to employees or workers that mightve had a rough day (or even anyone that might just need it). so my plan is to make post cards that thank them for their hard work. when i was thinking of this, i honestly thought that there isnt much effort put into those. like all i would do is probably just make a template then print a bunch of them. doesnt really seem genuine/sincere right? so i think that i should accompany it with a gift. i think that these gifts should at least have something that they would keep. not just like a one-dollar bill or something (im also not really made of money lol). but i think that it would also feel kinda superficial. if i were to pick a gift for the workers, i think that folding little pieces of origami would be nice. its not too expensive to make, (probably) wont be gone on the day that its received and i could add a bit of variety in case i see the same employee twice! 

anyways these are my goals for next year (and some longer term goals). but i think that i want to work and try and help myself.

# updates #1

hey im back

i just wanted to add a new goal as well as a change to my last goal.

firstly, i think that i honestly use chatgpt too much. i think its making me a little too reliant on it. i think that i should really cut back on using it. its not like im using it for anything thats important (most of it is just stuff im curious about) but i really think that figuring out stuff by yourself is alot more rewarding. idk i think im just too reliant on it. ill try and only use it for when i really dont have the time.

now for the change to my last goal. since im still on this vacation, i wanted to give the tour guide something. so i took some inspiration from the goal i made originally. i mean i made the thing but i think its too fragile since its just paper. what im thinking now is to use legos and make like little enclosures. afterwards i think i should glue it together and maybe make a keychain or something. honestly it might be a little expensive but i think that most working people deserve it! 

anyways thats all i had come up with so far. ill just update this whenever i feel like it. originally it was supposed to be like a yearly thing for like "new years resolutions" but i honestly think that ill just forget it about lol. a year is too long for someone as forgetful as me.

# updates #2

lol im back again but i wanna update the last goal again

i really am thinking about making this a club at my university but honestly im a little scared cuz im not confident enough in my abilities to do something like this

but if anyone from purdue is reading this and wants to do this, reach out to me. i guess while we have a smaller group we can just do it on our own in our little gc and have some hangouts (if u want lol) but its really up to u guys

after we get enough people i think making a club would really be nice since it could help open the doors for others to join (and we get funding so i wont have to buy materials *sob pray*).

anyways thanks for reading again lol
