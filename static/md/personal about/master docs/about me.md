# introduction

first, i want to say that im not going to be formal in this. its not because i dont respect u as a reader but its more so that i dont feel thats who i am.

i want to this to feel genuine and for me to be able to fully express myself.

# studies and career choice

firstly, i didnt really want to come to the states but since i didnt wanna disappoint my parents, i kinda just went with it. honestly i dont really think i regret it (with the exceptions of not being able to hangout with my high school friends).

i think its great to get some time to myself. maybe now i have too much time. im not really sure to be honest. the states is pretty great (politics aside) but i dont really think i mind where i am too much. i really think that whats making the experience so enjoyable is that i can be someone i might not be back in canada. i also think that more cities should be like university campuses since its really nice to walk around sometimes. im not an urban designer or civil engineer so dont trust my word on that but i just think its nice to be able to walk to most places.

anyways, i also wanna talk about my career choices. this is (mostly) independent of what university i would go to. originally, i wanted to major in computer science but i thought the job market was lil too cooked for me to try and pursue that. so i thought for a while and landed on math as my major. i do want to preface that i do love game development but i had only really thought of it as a hobby. anyways, i thought that math was a great choice since it (probably) wouldnt disappoint my parents and it was a great way to learn some of the inner workings of cool algorithms used in game dev. but after a talk (more like an argument lmao) with my parents, i decided to change to game development. i enjoy being creative but i really like the stem portion of it as well. since i also do have a background in computer science i just thought maybe itll work out for me lol (hopefully it does *cry emoji*).

# personality

i just want to give more information other cuz i dont really think mbti's are a great way to generalize people. i think everyones unique so there really isnt a way to categorize people. i guess this leads to my next point, i really dont enjoy being formal. i think it just limits how u can express urself. maybe im weird for thinking like this but i dont like the formality that comes with being strangers (ill address this later). 

another thing is that i enjoy honesty but to be completely honest with whoever might be reading this. im not that honest myself. i want to be more honest but i think its kinda hard since i dont wanna say something hurtful towards others. this letter is supposed to be pretty honest so hopefully itll stay that way (*pray emoji*).

i think i should talk about social stuff next. i dont mind talking online (id probably prefer that most of the time lol) but sometimes its nice to meet face to face. tbh i think im just saying this cuz i need a reason to be forced outside (i stay inside too much *sob emoji*). although if u were to talk to me online, i would probably be awkward unless i know u lol but hopefully ill warm up to u. i do prefer texting to video/voice calling but nowadays i feel more comfortable so i like having camera on while me and my friends play games. (related to that should i start streaming? i think it would be pretty fun and im honestly not expecting much from it).

relating back to the formality paragraph, i kinda just remembered it but i dont take a lot of things seriously (unless it is something or someone i care about lol). i dont know why but i just cant take stuff seriously, not that i downplay everything (or at least i hope it doesnt seem that way) but i think lifes just a lot better if u worry abt less things. anyways idrk where im going with this but i think everyone should just stop caring so much (not that its bad). i mean if it is something thats important of course it makes sense but i think its just weird to be nervous for tests and exams. im not saying this as an attack against people who feel that way but its just something that i had stopped really caring about. maybe its because i dont really enjoy studying for tests/exams but i think that ur life isnt really determined by grades. i think its much more important to care about stuff that mean something to u. of course if grades are important to u im not saying to stop caring but i think its much better to put that effort elsewhere. maybe its just because i didnt really have to study or put as much effort into studying growing up but idk. whatever i think im losing the plot a lil. anyways what im trying to say is to focus on whats important and stop focusing so much about the little things.

i guess if u care, what i like is kinda important right? if u really care to give me a present (i dont really need them lol i think im pretty comfortable with the stuff i have. im happy to accept them tho just dont think u have to get me one lol). anyways, i think that handmade things are a lot more sincere in terms of presents. i cant really describe it if im completely honest with u guys but it just makes me feel nice that someone cares enough about me to put in so much effort just to get me a gift. id like to think thats how i think but im pretty lazy. i do think that handmade presents are a lot cooler than other presents. i also really just enjoy making stuff. sorry to lowkey all of my friends cuz i dont think ive ever given a handmade present lol. i guess its kinda weird for me to talk about this since its kinda like im begging for presents but i just want to make it a little easier for others to know what i like. anyways i guess i just think im too untalented and lack effort lol. i do truly want to make handmade presents for others tho but i think i just make too many excuses for me to just play games lol.

also i guess this is kinda important but i like working in bursts. its probably because of how i am and cuz of burnout but when im really passionate abt something i just spend way too much time on it until i burnout again lol. i should probably fix this its not a great thing to do. but for me i think its a little weird since i burnout so often, i think that i burnout from playing video games sometimes. its really weird like the cycle is kinda like: work *right arrow* video games *right arrow* hobbies *right arrow* work. it just repeats over and over again. sometimes ill skip hobbies because i dont really have many so its pretty much just a cycle between burning out of work and video games. before my vacation, i think i burnt myself out of playing video games. its probably what led to me writing all this yap lol. anyways i think its something id like to fix.

this is probably the last point (and frankly the most important) so ill keep it short. i tend to overthink alot, especially when it comes to what others think about me. i probably wont overthink about this too much since i dont know whos reading this but if i do know u irl, u should probably be more honest with me (not that u should just go around saying everything thats on ur mind) but i dont mind listening. i think its important that if we're friends that we should be comfortable talking to each other about things that might be troubling each other. anyways im not trying to say that my friends arent honest, im just saying that im kinda dense and cant really pick up most things so just be blunt with me lol. if its something negative i dont mind, its better i know so i wont do something like that again.

lol i guess the last part wasnt very short but i think i just worded it poorly. hopefully u guys can understand it 

# trauma dumping

this part honestly feels like trauma dumping so dont read it if u dont want to. i just wanna write it down since i found out recently its nice to just talk about stuff openly. its def not as bad as a lot of people but idk i just wanna talk about it. also i dont want this to seem like im fishing for compliments or like words of affirmation, i just wanted to share it so please dont talk about this or anything. if u relate with this or js wanna talk about stuff, feel free to msg me.

ok so like im already regretting the title of this section since its not really trauma. i think its more like just stuff that i wish that i had done differently. theres honestly a lot of stuff i still want to keep hidden but if you guys ask me enough/i feel comfortable enough, ill update this post.

## family stuff

anyways, i want to start with talking about my family. i have one sister and no other siblings. (lowkey i probably shouldve moved this to somewhere else but its too late now and im too lazy). during the winter break, my family and my family friend's family went on a trip. its honestly the reason why im writing most of this and the goals page but thats kinda besides the point. i think what im trying to say it that, i had just felt kinda disconnected from my family or i guess both families. it was weird, i dont really know how to explain it. i think its honestly because i havent really been totally honest with my parents or my sister but i just feel that theres some strain in our relationship. during the trip, i found myself either wandering around alone or following my friend's family. it doesnt really make any sense or at least to me it doesnt. 

i also want to talk about something that just doesnt sit right with me. i think that during this trip, i havent been myself, its probably the lack of internet here but i think its great that i have bad internet. i think being separated from social media has really helped me and allowed me to really think about things thoroughly. anyways what im trying to say with this is that normally i dont feel comfortable walking around alone (especially in crowded areas) but on this trip i kinda would rather be alone then be with someone. maybe im weird for being like this but i felt more comfortable being with myself than being with either family. 

## burnout

next i kinda wanna talk about burnout. i think its something that makes me who i am. i mentioned it in the personality section but i think its pretty important that you know why i feel this way. i know its gonna sound at least a little corny but i wanna say that i had always been fairly smart. but burnout doesnt just happen because ur smart. 

the reason why ive been so burnt out is just because of an incident that happened in elementary school. i wanna say ive always liked math, probably since kindergarten but i found math to be the most interesting subject. but when ur little, schools probably have to teach u pretty quick to get u to understand the basics before they explain harder concepts. i guess it kinda makes sense now that i think about it but whatever. anyways back to the story i guess. maybe im misremembering since its been so long. but i think it was in grade 5 that i had started to burnout. i think i started getting burnt out cuz i felt that the math wasnt engaging enough. from what i remember, we were mostly learning about fractions in grade 5 but since i had always been somewhat proficient in math, i was in the advanced class (as i had moved to a private school). the advanced math class was always 2 grades ahead of the curriculum (i.e. in gr 4 i would be doing gr 6 math). i dont really remember why but i just felt that fractions werent worthy (probably could use a better word but idrc) of being in grade 7 math. like it had always felt like way too basic for something that was supposed to be grade 7 math. but then again i think most of it was supposed to be focused on the geometry while fractions and ratios were just kinda a side thing. i still cant remember why i remember fractions being the main issue but whatever. anyways i kinda just stopped enjoying math homework. 

before this i genuinely loved doing math. im not sure how it works in other schools but what they did was just gave us a list of numbers for questions in the textbook. during the math periods, i would spend my time just trying to finish the questions as quick as i could. i remember going back up to the teacher and asking for another unit to work on and them giving me some math contest questions since i had finished the textbook. but after grade 5 it just never felt the same. i just stopped enjoying doing it, like its weird to think about now but idk. i honestly dont even know if ive fully recovered from this burnout but id like to think i have. at some point i just stopped caring. maybe thats the reason i dont get nervous about stuff like tests and exams cuz i just couldnt really care less about it. 

## identity

ok so i was initially end it on the previous paragraph but i just thought of something else thats been on my mind. i think i struggle with my identity. i feel like i dont really have much of an identity right now other than me being "smart".

idk i think it just doesnt sit quite right with me. maybe im just attached to the identity that i had created over the past 18 years ive been alive but i really think that i should make a change. i dont know what i could do but i think my goals for the next few years can help quite a bit. i think the reason why i want to do this is mostly just because i dont really put myself out there so i want a way someone could recognize me and come up to me. maybe i just lack attention (which is probably right) but i think i should at least build some sort of identity for myself. 

ill just summarize what i want to do here. its gonna be pretty brief (hopefully) and probably mostly just a repeat of what i had already said in the section about what my goals were but whatever. if u do read this i do think that some feedback would be nice but im not gonna force it out of u or anything. just message me on somewhere (ill probably check it lol). if u dont have me added i guess u can just message me thru insta on the front page but honestly might be too much work. just do whatever lol. 

anyways, what i had thought to develop a sense of identity was to try and give back to people. honestly i think its pretty hard to do this especially for my friends and family but im just not to sure what to do with this. it kinda just hit me while on my trip (sorry for mentioning so many times it feels like im just seeking attention <span class="small-text">i probably am</span>). but i had thought that all the workers on my trip were working really hard. reason being, i think we underestimate the work that goes into a lot of things. 

for example, during the start of the trip i was thinking abt the food ive had during the trip and how it wasnt so great. but idk what to expect especially since they have to be cooking in bulk for hotels. it makes sense and its probably hard to taste all the different types of foods that you make so early in the morning. i guess another thing is that its probably really hard to cater to people who arent really familiar with the food in ur country so i think its hard to make food thatll taste good to everyone. maybe im just being a little bit stupid but i think its important to give credit where credit is due. i wanna give a few more examples because i really think that the people on my trip did an amazing job. for example, we had to drive quite a bit across the desert so i think its really impressive just being behind a wheel for so long. also just imagine the pain in their feet from pressing the gas and brake pedals *pray emoji*. also for the tour guide i think its really impressive how they memorize where we have to go as well lead the group, even if there are people who arent that interested in the topic (i.e. me). i think its really cool that they are able to do this especially as they have to plan things on the go so they must have a great network of people. i also think its really admirable that they are able to accommodate so many things that tourists want. on top of all of this, i think its really cool that all of them are able to wake up so early and stay up until so late. maybe my sleep schedule just sucks but i always end up sleeping like 10-12 hours.

anyways enough trauma dumping for the day. if i have more im willing to share, ill just add another paragraph i guess.

# inspirations

well i dont really know if the title of this section is very accurate but i think that i do look up to them to a certain extent

i dont tend to praise others (probably something i should fix tbh) but i think there are some people that deserve the recognition

## quagmire toilet gaming (seriously this is the name lol)

i wanna start off with someone i think i would want to be like. honestly its kinda funny but its a shitpost youtuber. they havent really posted in a while (3 years) so im wondering if theyre doing alright. anyways their handle is "quagmire toilet gaming". i know it sounds silly and it probably is meant to be but even though they just post random videos, they always write about how theyve been feeling. some viewers read it but i still think its pretty brave of them to do so. i think the reason i wanna be like them is because i want to be more open with others and them being able to post stuff like that seems so cool to me. i do want to try and do things like that in the future. like posting things but just including a short mini paragraph of how im feeling or why i posted it. i think its also nice if someone were to read it but im not really trying to do it for that reason. also i too wanna become a silly goober who isnt afraid of sharing whatevers on their mind. not like i wanna have split personalities but i think its nice to sometimes separate all the serious stuff from ur life.

## employees

yes it might seem a little weird but i really do believe that after this trip, ive realized how hard it is to actually work a job. ill be honest but the only job ive done i kinda just half assed it. i was like the stereotypical minimum wage worker who slacks off a bunch. except that i wasnt minimum wage and actually got paid pretty decently for the work i didnt do. 

anyways i do wanna address why i believe that i look up to employees. to any employees of any kind that might be reading this, i want to thank u guys for the work u do. i genuinely mean this even if u dont believe u arent doing well at ur job or that u think ur slacking.

ok with that out of the way, i think the main reason i look up to them so much is just due to the fact they show up. ill talk about some examples (sorry if ur not included) but hopefully even if i dont cover ur job that u can find some reason to keep going.

first, i think customer service workers deserve to be recognized. whether that be at a starbucks working as a cashier or js someone working at some sort of reception. i think that the people that they have to put up with are just really annoying. im not saying this like customers are always wrong or something but i know that its not all sunshine and rainbows. like honestly even like working as a cashier and u greet the customer and they dont do it back (which im a culprit of), i think that honestly just hurts. but those who work in these environments end up getting used to it. all im trying to say is that catering to customers isnt always so easy. while some people might shit on others because of their pay or rank, i truly believe that we are all capable of change and have an impact on this world. it might feel small but someday u might understand how important that job was.

honestly i cant rly think of much others (ik i said i was gonna cover others but im sorry *sob*). i think that the reasoning for why i believe the job is difficult and why i believe i look up to them might be fairly similar but i still think that a lot of people dont know how important the work they do is.

## friends

i think my friends are another one of my biggest inspirations. i think that anyone who has friends (hopefully all of u) truly know how important a friend is. while i know that not all friends have the same relationship to u as others, i still believe they are important. 

but i think for this section, im mostly talking about friends that celebrate with u when u succeed and try to comfort u when ur down. speaking from personal experience, its hard to feel the second one unless u are open about ur feelings with others. anyways, i just wanna say to any friend of mine who may be reading this, i truly appreciate all the stuff that u mightve done for me. if u are someone who might feel like ur distant just reach out if u want, im always open to talk. i dont want to feel like im the only one being helped lol. 

anyways lol i do wanna just state that this section isnt in any particular order, like i dont think that quagmire toilet gaming is more important than u lol. hopefully u dont overthink abt it too much. but i think that friends are great because they love to see u succeed and when they succeed it only really pushes u to do better (unless u have an unhealthy relationship with them but would u really call them ur friend then?) i guess we all have our own circumstances that lead us to being "friends" with others yk? ive had my fair share but im glad that most werent lol. 

i know i didnt really say much content in this section except for thanking my friends but i just want to end this part by saying, please keep in contact with friends that u cherish. i really think that these people are really hard to come by. its not every day that u meet a friend, even less so one that u truly feel a connection with. 

anyways i just wanna thank my friends (or past friends <span class="small-text">if u see it that way ig</span>) for all that they did *peace sign*

sorry but i cant really think of any others but hopefully i can add more since there are alot of people who are reasons for why im where i am today.

# things i should work on

i think theres always room for improvement. i mean ur probably like "no shit" after reading whatever i wrote. but i still theres still things i cant really put under other sections. i also dont want to list them out as if im already working towards it or something but more just to let u guys know. i also do want some input. i dont really care if u might see it as negative i think any input is good (as long as it isnt just full on hate *pray*).

## money issues

anyways i guess ill start by saying that i think i have a problem with spending money. not in the way u might be thinking.

**i dont like spending money.** 

its not that i dont enjoy splurging and buying things i like. but i think its more about that i dont feel comfortable spending money that i dont think is mine. most of my money isnt really mine at the moment even though it is (probably) registered under my name. the money in reality is my parents. i havent really worked for money myself (with the exception of just one summer) so i dont think i should be spending money willy-nilly. i think the main problem isnt that im scared of spending money rather its more of a problem of me thinking that spending money is bad and i should only really get the cheapest thing. of course i do still spend money on things that i really like but often i find myself looking at the prices more than actually looking at the product itself. personally i think that ill get more comfortable with spending money if i actually start working for it. so i guess ill just have to wait and see and hopefully itll get better. (hopefully not to a point where i just start blowing money on everything)

## social anxiety (kinda)

ok now i think its probably time for me to talk abt my social anxiety. honestly i dont think i should even call it that since its not that bad. but i think its something that i find myself struggling with since i dont want to come off as rude to others. 

this is probably the same for a lot of people but i just cant take complements well. i dont really know what to say back. like "thanks"? but like that just feels its insincere. like i should probably complement them back but like im too awkward to say that without seeming like i have ulterior motives.

another thing is when people hold the door for me or something. i think i just have trouble saying thank you. like i dont think its cuz im rude (idk maybe it is) but its hard for me to say thank you. most of the time ill either just stare at them awkwardly a little then maybe a little head bow or something but i just cant utter the words "thanks" or "thank you". 

my thought process is kinda like "i should say thank you" then when it comes my turn i either am still thinking this or that if i say thanks after itll seem awkward. anyways i dont really know how to fix this one but im hoping giving out the little presents to employees will help.

## saying no

another big problem i would say is the ability to say no. i know it might seem rude to think that way to some but i really think its pretty admirable to know what u wanna do. ive always had trouble saying what im really feeling (partly why this letter is so long). i think the reason why im like this is cuz im scared of how others might feel. i dont want others to get hurt over something i said. but i did say this was a problem so i do wanna explain why i think this way.

honestly if i didnt have this problem, i would definitely not be where i am today. the reason being, i just had trouble saying no to my parents. like they would always be looking for opportunities for me. it would always go something like: 

> parents: u wanna do ___? 
>
> me: sure 

it was almost never a definite yes. i guess to most people saying "sure" instead of "yes" is like a telltale sign of them not wanting to do something but my parents' first language isnt english so i dont blame them for not picking up on that. 

the main reason why i say "sure" to a lot of things is because i dont want to harshly turn someone down. (i guess im repeating myself here but) i would always do this with my parents when they asked if i wanted to participate in some type of extracurricular activity. honestly, most of them i enjoyed at least a little (def not the hw tho lol). but i do think that they did end up taking up too much of my time. 

i guess the problem is that i cant really back out of most things cuz i feel like im hurting the person whos offering. but i think im getting a little better at this but not in a good way. its mostly cuz im only really comfortable doing this with my family but i think its just cuz of my relationship with them. i guess it is cuz ive been around them for the longest but its really starting to damage my relationship with them. like if im being totally honest from almost everyones perspective, if they saw how i acted i think they would think a horrible person. well i dont necessarily disagree but like cut me some slack *sob*

anyways if i get better at this, i think it can also help me understand how to turn things down politely. 

## overthinking

this is probably one of the biggest problems i think i have. i dont really know exactly when it started but it was definitely after i started feeling self-conscious. although it probably saved me many times, especially in social situations, i really think that its starting to limit what i feel comfortable doing. while im not saying that i wanna do anything and everything, i think i have a lot of missed opportunities and misunderstandings caused by it.

ok well honestly, idk if i would call it misunderstandings but more that i kinda shut down. this happens often when im getting scolded (either by parents or teachers). i still remember in elementary school when i got into a lot of trouble (cuz i wasnt exactly a great kid) but every time i would go to the principals office, i would kinda just sit there and not say anything. 

this issue didnt really dawn on me until i reached high school. we had french in one of the smaller rooms and idk why but i decided to say a snarky remark directed to our teacher. it didnt take long for me to end up in the principals office but when they asked why i did that or if i thought it was appropriate i just shut down. in my mind i was thinking if it was worth it to even say anything. my thoughts were that if i said more i would probably get into more trouble cuz theyll call my parents but i also thought that if i admitted it then they would punish me harder. so it was really just who i wanted to get scolded by. since i didnt say anything, i ended up getting scolded by both *sob*.

it does mostly happen when i think im gonna get in trouble but it really happens when im writing. its honestly just getting annoying. i end up deleting things and thinking too much about the specifics like whether to rephrase a sentence or use another word. it just ends up taking too much time for me to finish writing something but another problem is when im texting. its probably cuz i dont really text anyone other than my close friends that i game with but i dont really know what to do if they dont respond. it just sits in the back of my mind and ends up becoming too taxing. at some point ill just send another message or try to clear myself of any misunderstandings like "sorry i was doing ___ so i couldnt respond" or "i went to sleep early srry". i dont know why i do this but i just dont want them to think that im ignoring them.

anyways i should probably fix this. im not really sure how but hopefully u can give me some ideas. 

## pride

i think that my pride is another thing i really need to fix. id like to think of it in two parts: my cultural identity and wanting to be right.



ill probably have more stuff here but im not too sure how ill add them. its also kinda weird to talk about problems right? idk maybe im the weird one here

# how i view the world

ok first of all, im going to keep this non-political. if u ask me questions about politics i probably wont respond unless its something that i really stand with/against. anyways i just wanted to talk about a few things thats been on my mind. i didnt really know how to categorize this but i think its fine if i leave it as it is right now.

## hard work

im gonna be quite honest here, this is probably just gonna be a repeat of the part from the inspirations blurb. i think its just something that is important to me. 

to be honest, the main reason i ever really developed this mindset was because of how i acted towards others in the past. its not really like i did something bad or anything, its more like i said some harsh things to others who were just trying to get along with their day.

so firstly, i want to say that i think that we should all view the world differently. well i mean i know we do but i mean like (maybe u alr do this) but i think that we should all consider each others circumstances before acting.

im not saying to like overthink about like maybe something traumatic happened and thats why theyre rude (it could be true tho). but im more so saying that we all have our rough days and sometimes its nice to have someone (even a stranger) be somewhat understanding. i guess i dont know how u as the reader live so i cant really force u to relate with me. but while growing up, i really didnt enjoy being open. i honestly cant quite remember why i was like this, i think it mightve been because i thought i was needlessly just craving attention but im not too sure. anyways, i just want to say that i feel like kids (i guess we're adults now) from my generation tend to be more reserved. im not saying this as a one case fits all type of way but im just saying that i think its hard for us to really be honest with each other. 

i just hope that others might find peace in the understanding u might be able to bring by sympathizing with their (perhaps ur theoretical) situation.

## trust

this is another thing that i find is quite important to me. i dont think ive been betrayed by anyone but i still think there were times that it felt like it. however, it still hurt when i felt that i was betrayed by someone i may have trusted.

honestly, i cant really say when i have been betrayed but thinking now but i just think i was a little too naive as a kid.

anyways sorry for that weird aside but i really believe that we should at least trust each other a little bit more than we have. while im not saying to trust anyone and everyone but i really hope that u can find it in urself to be a little more understanding. 

what brings me to write this section was my trip with my family (i swear this is the last time i bring it up). it wasnt like i didnt trust them but more so that they didnt trust the locals. i know that as a tourist u have ur rights to be skeptical and all that but i really think that the locals arent trying to necessarily harm u. of course im not saying all locals arent trying to harm u like if theres suspicious people dont go up to them but im sure u alr know that.

i guess i should probably explain more about why i felt that way with my family. this also somewhat relates to the hard work section i talked about previously. it was during our visit to the local market. we were just trying to look for souvenirs or really anything that we wanted to take back home with us. but the thing that really bugged me was how my family treated the locals. its not like they were like acting as if they were below us but it was more so how untrustworthy they think the locals are. for instance, my parents (especially my mom) made it clear that people try to steal your bag when u arent looking but honestly i did think that i was quite safe with how i carried my bag. it also helps that it has a zipper. anyways all their talk did wasnt make it seem more safe for me but quite the opposite, i think that what they had said actually made me more paranoid. in the end i guess i just started doing what they did because they said so but i really felt bad for the locals to see tourists this scared of them. the weird thing is that this also applied with the vendors. this in particular bugged me the most because i know that its hard to have a tourist stop and check out ur shop when so many others sell similar things. i still think its weird how tourists shop the way they do, like i get saving money but like shopping for a better deal vs shopping for what u like?? like honestly on vacation as well?? i really cant stand it to be honest but i also understand where theyre coming from.

sorry i kinda rambled a little there but i guess what im trying to say is that i think it might be hard to trust others (especially have if uve gone thru something) but i really think that instead of thinking of strangers as no trust, i think they deserve to have at least a little of ur trust.

hopefully i didnt yap for too long but i just hope that u can understand my stance. i think its unfair how most people treat others (im not in the clear either) but i hope that we can all try and strive to be better and more understanding.
